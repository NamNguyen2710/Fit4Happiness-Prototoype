          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>Dear users,</p>
          <p>
            Our team created a website named fit4happiness.site. Our focus is
            fitness, more specifically bodybuilding. Our motivation comes from
            the backstory of Duong Tran, our lead manager, who overcame obesity
            as a teenager, with many difficulties in his training. Therefore,
            Duong himself and the Fit4Happiness team want to help new fitness
            trainers to have a more visible pathway to obtain consistent
            results. We name our site and company, Fit4Happiness, as we believe
            a healthy lifestyle is the fundamental material to create a life
            filled with happiness.
