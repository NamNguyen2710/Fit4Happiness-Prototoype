      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Our team created a website named fit4happiness.site. Our focus is
        fitness, more specifically bodybuilding. Our motivation comes from the
        backstory of Duong Tran, our lead manager, who overcame obesity as a
        teenager, with many difficulties in his training. Therefore, Duong
        himself and the Fit4Happiness team want to help new fitness trainers to
        have a more visible pathway to obtain consistent results. We name our
        site and company, Fit4Happiness, as we believe a healthy lifestyle is
        the fundamental material to create a life filled with happiness.{" "}
